        <p>My favorite hobby is Reading. It is one of the best hobbies in the world in my opinion. It's one of the best, because reading allows my imagination to expand and makes my brain think a lot. Whenever I read, I think about what could happen if this happened. It really makes my imagination going. My favorite series is the Percy Jackson series. Its my favorite, because it has a lot of adventure and cliff-hangers, and also makes me think if this didnt happen, would the story change by a lot or a little. I love thinking about it, too. The series has 5 books, The Lightning Theif, The Sea of Monsters, The Titan's Curse, The Battle of the Labyrinth, and The Last Olympian. In these books, Percy, the main character, is born as the son of the god, Poseidon, one of the elest of the olumpians. He has to save the world against Kronos, the Titan Lord. In the first book, Percy thinks his mom is dead and goes on a quest with his friends to find her. In the second book, Percy's friend, Grover goes to find Pan, and gets lost in the Sea of Monsters. Percy and Annabeth go to find him. In the third book, Annabeth and Artemis, the godess of the hunt, get captured and Percy, Grover, and a few of the hunters go to find them. They fight Atlas, the titan that holds up the sky. In the fourth book, Percy goes through the Labyrinth to find Adriadne's String before Luke, a friend who betrayed Percy and now leads the Titan army, so they can destroy the Labyrinth and keep the Titan army away from their Half-Blood camp. In the fifth book, Percy fights the Titan Lord, Kronos, who is in the body of Luke. Kronos's army fights at the bottom of Olympus against the Centaurs and the Skeletons summoned by Nico and Hades, the lord of the dead. At the end, Luke comes back to consciousness, and kills himself, using the cursed blade that he gave to Annabeth, and Luke was the hero. This explains why the Percy Jackson series is my favorite, wasn't that very interesting?</p>
